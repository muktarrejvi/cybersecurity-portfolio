## 🔐 Security Fundamentals – Key Concepts

---

### 🔺 CIA Triad
Security is built around three core principles:

- **Confidentiality** – Protecting the secrecy of information.
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate, complete, and unaltered.
- **Availability** – Ensuring information is accessible when needed.

---

### 🔐 Authentication
Verifies **who** someone is using one or more factors:

- **Type 1:** Something you know (e.g., password)
- **Type 2:** Something you have (e.g., smart card)
- **Type 3:** Something you are (e.g., fingerprint)

---

### 🧾 Authenticity
- Ensures the **message** comes from a trusted source and **hasn't been modified**.

---

### ✍️ Nonrepudiation
- Guarantees that a sender **cannot deny** sending a message
- Achieved through methods like **digital signatures**.

---

### 🔒 Privacy
- Involves proper **handling of personal data**, giving individuals **control and consent** over how their data is used.

---

### 🛡️ Information Assurance
- Measures how **effective security controls** are in protecting information.

## 🛡️ Common Cybersecurity Threats and Attack Types

---

### 🌐 Fake Websites
- Used to **harvest sensitive information**, such as login credentials or personal data.
- Common in phishing campaigns.

---

### 💣 Malware
- Any **malicious software** designed to cause harm or unauthorized access.

---

#### 🦠 Virus
- A type of malware typically **embedded in another application**.
- Requires user action to spread.

#### 🐴 Trojan
- A **disguised virus** that appears useful but is actually malicious.

#### 🐛 Worm
- A **self-replicating virus** that spreads across systems without user interaction.

#### 👁️ Rootkit
- Malware that **hides its presence** by altering the operating system.
- Designed to give persistent, undetectable access.

---

### 🧠 Social Engineering
- **Manipulating people** into taking actions or revealing confidential information.
- Example: phishing emails, pretexting, baiting.

---

### 📜 Scripting Attacks
- Manipulating input fields to produce **unintended or harmful results**.
- Common types: **SQL injection, XSS (Cross-site Scripting)**

---

### 🧱 Vulnerability-Specific Attacks
- Attacks that exploit **known software bugs or flaws**.
- Can often be prevented by applying security patches and updates.

## 💻 Elements of a Cyberattack: A Summary

---

A typical cyberattack involves several key stages carried out by a cybercriminal:

---

### 1. 🕵️ Conduct Research
- The attacker gathers as much **information** as possible about the target.
- This can include:
  - System architecture
  - Publicly available data
  - Employee details (e.g., via social engineering)

---

### 2. 🛠️ Exploit Targets
- Uses tools such as **malware** to take advantage of **vulnerabilities**.
- The goal is to gain **unauthorized access** to systems or data.

---

### 3. 🔥 Do Bad Things
Once inside, the attacker may:

- **Steal data** – Compromises **Confidentiality**  
- **Modify data** – Compromises **Integrity**  
- **Destroy data or disrupt services** – Compromises **Availability**

> 🔺 These actions directly violate the **CIA Triad** of cybersecurity.

## 🔒 Secure Protocols

- **Definition**: Protocols that **encrypt data** while it is being transmitted across a network.  
- **Purpose**: To protect the **confidentiality** and **integrity** of data in transit, preventing interception or tampering.  

### ✅ Examples of Secure Protocols
- **HTTPS** → Secure web browsing (encrypted HTTP).  
- **SSH** → Secure remote login and command execution.  
- **TLS/SSL** → Provides encryption for various applications (web, email, VoIP).  
- **SFTP/FTPS** → Secure file transfer.  
- **IPSec** → Encrypts and authenticates IP packets.  

---

🔑 **Key Idea**: Using secure protocols ensures that sensitive data (like passwords, payment info, or personal data) remains protected during transmission.

## 🔢 TCP/UDP Port Ranges with Examples

Port numbers are categorized into three main ranges, as defined by **IANA**:

| Range            | Name                  | Description | Common Examples |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **0 – 1023**     | Well-known ports      | Standard services and protocols. Also called **system ports**. | - **20/21** FTP (File Transfer Protocol)<br>- **22** SSH (Secure Shell)<br>- **23** Telnet<br>- **25** SMTP (Email)<br>- **53** DNS (Domain Name System)<br>- **67/68** DHCP (Dynamic Host Config)<br>- **80** HTTP (Web)<br>- **110** POP3 (Email)<br>- **143** IMAP (Email)<br>- **161** SNMP (Network Management)<br>- **443** HTTPS (Secure Web)<br>- **3389** RDP (Remote Desktop) |
| **1024 – 49151** | Registered ports      | Assigned to vendor-specific or widely used applications. | - **1433** Microsoft SQL Server<br>- **1521** Oracle Database<br>- **2049** NFS (Network File System)<br>- **2082/2083** cPanel admin<br>- **3306** MySQL Database<br>- **3389** (sometimes registered for RDP)<br>- **3690** Subversion (SVN)<br>- **5432** PostgreSQL<br>- **5900** VNC (Virtual Network Computing)<br>- **8080** HTTP Alternative (often web apps) |
| **49152 – 65535**| Dynamic / Private ports | **Ephemeral ports**, used temporarily by client applications for outbound connections. Not registered with IANA. | - A web browser connecting to HTTPS might use a random port like **49160** → server **443**<br>- Skype / Zoom dynamically allocate ports<br>- Online games use these for peer-to-peer connections<br>- BitTorrent clients often bind to dynamic ports |

---

### 🔑 Key Notes:
- **Well-known ports** are fixed and universally recognized.  
- **Registered ports** may vary but are often standardized by vendors.  
- **Dynamic/private ports** are chosen by the OS when a client initiates a connection.  
- Example:  
  - Client (ephemeral port `49160`) → Server (`443` HTTPS).  
  - When session ends, the ephemeral port is released.  

## 🌐 OSI Model: Application & Presentation Layers

### Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Note**: "Application" here refers to **protocols used by applications**, not the apps themselves.  
- **Function**: Provides services that allow user applications (like browsers or email clients) to communicate over a network.  
- **Common Protocols**:  
  - DNS → Domain Name resolution  
  - FTP / SFTP → File transfers  
  - SNMP → Network management  
  - Telnet & SSH → Remote access  
  - HTTP / HTTPS → Web communication  
  - LDAP → Directory services  
- **Data Unit**: `Data` (same for Layers 5–7)

| 3     | **Network**     | Determines best path, logical addressing, routing of packets.                 | IP, ICMP, IPsec, RIP, OSPF, BGP          | Packets   |
| 2     | **Data Link**   | Provides node-to-node delivery, physical addressing (MAC), error detection.   | Ethernet, PPP, Switches, ARP, Frame Relay| Frames    |
| 1     | **Physical**    | Transmits raw bits over a physical medium (cables, signals, voltages).        | Cables, Hubs, Wi-Fi (radio waves), Fiber | Bits      |

# 🌐 Network Fundamentals Summary

### Key Points
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** and **WAN (Wide Area Network)** are the main network types.  
- Networks can be **wired** (cables) or **wireless** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC).  
- Devices use **MAC addresses** (hardware) and **IP addresses** (logical).  
- **OSI Model** has 7 layers; **TCP/IP Model** has 4 layers.  
- Two versions of IP: **IPv4** and **IPv6**.
