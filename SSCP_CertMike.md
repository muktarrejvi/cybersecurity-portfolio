   - Senior-level official with overall responsibility for a dataset.  
   - Defines policies and guidelines for data use/security.  
   - Makes final decisions on data handling.  
   - Example: VP of HR = Data Owner for employee data.  

2. **Data Steward**  
   - Implements the policies set by the Data Owner.  
   - Handles day-to-day governance (e.g., who can access data).  
   - Reports to the Data Owner.  
   - Example: Director of HR Information Services.  

3. **Data Custodian**  
   - IT staff/system administrators who manage data storage and processing.  
   - Ensure backups, encryption, access controls, compliance.  
   - Rarely make policy decisions but enforce protections.  

4. **Data User**  
   - Employees (analysts, managers, service staff) who interact with data daily.  
   - Must comply with rules set by owners/stewards.  
   - Responsible for avoiding unauthorized disclosure.  

---

### 🌍 External Roles
- **Data Subjects**  
  - The individuals described in collected data (e.g., employees, customers).  
  - Not part of governance structure but hold privacy rights.  

- **Data Processors**  
  - Third parties handling data on behalf of the organization.  
  - Perform tasks like data entry, analysis, transmission, or destruction.  
  - Must follow policies/security requirements set by Data Owner/Controller.  

---

### ⚠️ Key Distinction
- **System Owner ≠ Data Owner**  
  - Owning IT infrastructure does not mean owning the data stored/processed within it.  
  - Important for internal governance and inter-organizational data sharing.  

---

✅ Strong data governance requires coordination between **owners, stewards, custodians, and users**, while respecting the rights of **data subjects** and enforcing policies with **processors**.
