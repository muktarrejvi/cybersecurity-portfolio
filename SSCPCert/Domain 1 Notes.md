- Protect physical spaces containing critical assets — servers, networking gear, backups, and sensitive data.
- Prevent unauthorized access, theft, or tampering.

### 🔹 Facility Types & Security Focus

| Facility Type | Description | Security Concern |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Data Centers** | Houses servers, storage, and networking infrastructure. | Strict access control, CCTV, and visitor logging. |
| **Server Rooms** | Smaller, often ad-hoc setups. | Risk of poor controls, require same standards as data centers. |
| **Media Storage Facilities** | Hold backups and recovery data (often off-site). | Equal or greater security than main data center. |
| **Evidence Storage Rooms** | For forensic evidence; maintain chain of custody. | Tamper-proof, logged, restricted access. |
| **Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs)** | Network distribution hubs throughout buildings. | Locked, monitored, with limited authorized access. |
| **Wiring Closets** | Contain cables and connections across facilities. | Risk of eavesdropping or tampering; must be secured. |
| **Other Restricted Areas** | Operations centers, control rooms. | Inventory and assess all sensitive locations. |

### 🔹 Key Practices
- Maintain an inventory of sensitive areas.  
- Conduct **regular physical security assessments**.  
- Apply **layered security controls** — locks, cameras, access logs, alarms.

### ✅ Takeaway
> “Physical protection is the foundation of cybersecurity — without it, logical controls can easily be bypassed.”

## 2. Data Center Environmental Controls

### 🔹 Purpose
Maintain optimal environmental conditions for reliable and safe operation of electronic systems.

### 🔹 Environmental Factors

| Factor | Description | Standard / Range |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Temperature** | Prevent overheating and hardware degradation. | **64.4°F–80.6°F** (ASHRAE Expanded Environmental Envelope) |
| **Humidity** | Avoid condensation (too high) or static (too low). | **Dew point: 15.8°F–59°F** |
| **Airflow** | Maintain front-to-back cooling. | Implement **Hot Aisle/Cold Aisle** layout. |

### 🔹 Cooling Design
- Equipment draws **cool air from front**, expels **hot air from back**.  
- **Hot Aisle/Cold Aisle** alternation maximizes cooling efficiency.  
- **HVAC systems** regulate temperature and humidity automatically.

### 🔹 Energy Consideration
- Newer standards reduce overcooling → lower energy use and carbon footprint.

### ✅ Takeaway
> “Controlled temperature, humidity, and airflow keep data centers stable and extend equipment life.”

## 3. Data Center Environmental Protection

### 🔹 Purpose
Protect critical infrastructure from **fire, flooding, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).**

---

### 🔸 Fire Protection

**Fire Triangle:** Oxygen + Heat + Fuel → remove one to extinguish.  
**Fire Extinguisher Classes:**
| Class | Fire Type | Example |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **A** | Common combustibles | Paper, wood |
| **B** | Flammable liquids | Gasoline, oil |
| **C** | Electrical fires | Server/equipment fires |
| **D** | Metal fires | Industrial use |
| **K** | Kitchen fires | Cooking oils, fats |

**Suppression Systems:**
- **Wet Pipe:** Water-filled at all times (risky for data centers).  
- **Dry Pipe:** Water released only after fire detection (safer).  
- **Chemical Systems:** Remove oxygen — used with caution for occupied spaces.

**Detection:**  
- Sensors detect **heat, smoke, or chemical precursors** in early stages.

---

### 🔸 Flooding Protection
- Avoid locating data centers below ground or near water lines.  
- Use **moisture sensors** and proper drainage design.  
- Be aware of fire suppression leaks as potential flood risks.

---

### 🔸 Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
- EMI can **disrupt operations** or **leak information** (emanations).  
- Mitigation: shielded cabling, separation of power and data lines.  
- **Faraday cages**: advanced protection (used in classified facilities).

---

### ✅ Takeaway
> “Plan for heat, fire, water, and radiation — environmental resilience protects uptime and data integrity.”

## 4. Physical Access Control

### 🔹 Purpose
Prevent unauthorized entry into facilities, detect intrusions, and record activity.

### 🔹 Access Control Mechanisms

| Method | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Preset Locks** | Mechanical keys — require strict key management. |
| **Cipher Locks** | Keypad entry — shared or individual PINs. |
| **Card Access Systems** | Swipe, proximity, or smart cards. |
| **Biometric Locks** | Use fingerprints, retina, or voice for identity verification. |

### 🔹 Anti-Tailgating Controls
- **Mantraps:** Two-door systems verifying one person per entry.
- **Security Personnel:** Monitor access logs and enforce rules.

### 🔹 Monitoring and Detection
- **Motion/Noise Sensors:** Detect unexpected movement or activity.  
- **CCTV / IP Cameras:**  
  - **Deterrent control:** visible presence.  
  - **Detective control:** record and analyze events.  
  - Use **infrared** for low-light environments.

### 🔹 Physical Barriers & Deterrents
| Type | Function |
|-------|-----------|
| **Fences & Bollards** | Prevent unauthorized vehicle/pedestrian entry. |
| **Cages** | Protect racks in shared data centers. |
| **Lighting & Signage** | Increase visibility, deter intruders, support legal enforcement. |
| **Industrial Camouflage** | Conceal sensitive sites to avoid attention (ground and aerial). |

### ✅ Takeaway
> “Layered access control, detection, and deterrence combine to secure the facility perimeter and interior.”

## 5. Visitor Management

### 🔹 Purpose
Ensure controlled, auditable, and monitored access for visitors and contractors.

### 🔹 Visitor Control Procedures
- Define **who can authorize** access and **under what conditions**.
- Maintain a **visitor log** (paper or electronic).
- Require **visible ID badges**:
  - Clearly labeled as “Visitor”.
  - Indicate if **escort required**.
- Distinguish employees from visitors visually.

### 🔹 Escort & Monitoring
- Escorts accompany visitors unless unescorted access is pre-approved.
- Cameras monitor visitor-accessible zones (disclosure required).

### 🔹 Device and Recording Restrictions
- Limit or ban **phones, cameras, and audio/video recording**.
- Some facilities require devices to be stored in **secure lockers**.

### ✅ Takeaway
> “Effective visitor control ensures transparency, accountability, and minimizes insider threat exposure.”
