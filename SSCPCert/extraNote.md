## RSA Key Length Comparison

- **1024-bit** ❌ Insecure (deprecated)  
- **2048-bit** ✅ Current standard minimum (good for today)  
- **3072-bit** ✅ Stronger long-term protection with reasonable performance  
- **4096-bit** 🔒 Very strong but heavier performance impact  

According to modern cryptographic guidance (e.g., NIST), **RSA 3072-bit** provides security comparable to **128-bit symmetric encryption** and is considered suitable for long-term protection.
