## RSA Key Length Comparison

- **1024-bit** ❌ Insecure (deprecated)  
- **2048-bit** ✅ Current standard minimum (good for today)  
- **3072-bit** ✅ Stronger long-term protection with reasonable performance  
- **4096-bit** 🔒 Very strong but heavier performance impact  

According to modern cryptographic guidance (e.g., NIST), **RSA 3072-bit** provides security comparable to **128-bit symmetric encryption** and is considered suitable for long-term protection.

### Containerization (C)

Containerization effectively isolates corporate applications and data from personal applications on the same device.

This separation:
- Prevents corporate data leakage
- Maintains security boundaries
- Allows users to continue personal use of the device

It is commonly used in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments to protect organizational data while preserving user privacy

### Key Metric: Number of Reported Data Breaches

The number of data breaches reported since implementation is a key metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of a new data encryption protocol.  

This metric directly indicates whether the protocol is successfully protecting sensitive data.

**Rationale:**
- Fewer breaches after implementation may suggest improved protection.
- An increase or no change in breaches may indicate weaknesses in configuration, implementation, or complementary controls.
- Should be evaluated alongside other security metrics for a comprehensive assessment.

Implementing **digital certificates** provides a **secure** and **robust** method for **device authentication**. **Certificates** can uniquely **identify** and **verify** **authorized devices** by **cryptographically binding** them to a specific **identity**.

Using a **redundant array of independent disks (RAID)** configuration provides **redundancy** and **fault tolerance**, ensuring **high availability** of the **shared storage**. If one **disk fails**, others can continue to provide **data access** without interruption.

**Minimization of harm** is an ethical principle guiding the investigator to avoid unnecessary damage to individuals' **reputations**, **privacy**, and **well-being**, especially in **non-criminal matters**.
