# Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis Domain — Key Takeaways

## Overview
The **Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis** domain (Domain 3 of the SSCP Exam) represents **15% of total exam questions**.  
It focuses on identifying, analyzing, monitoring, and managing risks in cybersecurity operations.

---

## 1. Risk Assessment

### Key Ideas
- **Risk Assessment** helps prioritize risks based on **likelihood** and **impact** to allocate limited security resources effectively.
- **Core Terms**:
  - **Threat** – External event or actor that could harm systems (e.g., hackers, fire, malware).
  - **Threat Vector** – The method or pathway an attacker uses (e.g., phishing, USB infection).
  - **Vulnerability** – Weakness in controls or configurations (e.g., missing patches, weak passwords).
  - **Risk** – The potential loss when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

> ⚠️ No risk exists unless both a threat *and* a vulnerability are present.

### Likelihood and Impact
- **Likelihood** – Probability of the event occurring.  
  Example: Earthquakes are more likely in California than Wisconsin.
- **Impact** – The level of damage caused if the risk occurs.

### Assessment Techniques
- **Qualitative Assessment** – Uses subjective categories (Low / Medium / High).
- **Quantitative Assessment** – Uses numeric and data-based evaluation.

---

## 2. Quantitative Risk Assessment

Quantitative analysis gives numerical values to risks using measurable data.

### Core Variables
| Variable | Definition | Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **AV (Asset Value)** | Estimated dollar value of an asset | $20M data center |
| **EF (Exposure Factor)** | Percentage of asset lost if risk occurs | 50% flood damage |
| **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** | Expected dollar loss per incident (`AV × EF`) | $10M |
| **ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)** | Frequency of risk per year | 0.01 (1% chance) |
| **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)** | Expected yearly loss (`SLE × ARO`) | $100,000 |

### Key Formula Summary
```
SLE = AV × EF
ALE = SLE × ARO
```

### Reliability Metrics
| Metric | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| **MTTF** – Mean Time to Failure | Average lifespan of non-repairable assets |
| **MTBF** – Mean Time Between Failures | Average time between failures for repairable assets |
| **MTTR** – Mean Time to Repair | Average time needed to repair a failed component |

These metrics help estimate system reliability and expected downtime.

---

## 3. Risk Management (Risk Treatment)

Once risks are identified and prioritized, organizations must decide how to handle them. There are **four main strategies**:

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Avoidance** | Eliminate the activity causing the risk | Move data center out of flood zone |
| **Transference** | Shift the financial risk to another party | Buy flood or cyber insurance |
| **Mitigation** | Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact | Install flood barriers, patch systems |
| **Acceptance** | Acknowledge and accept the risk if mitigation is too costly | Continue operations and plan recovery |

> Accepting a risk ≠ Ignoring it.  
> Acceptance must be documented and approved after cost-benefit analysis.

### Risk Types
- **Inherent Risk** – Natural level of risk before controls.
- **Residual Risk** – Risk remaining after controls.
- **Control Risk** – Risk introduced by the controls themselves.
- **Risk Tolerance / Appetite** – The level of risk an organization is willing to accept.

The goal:  
**Residual Risk + Control Risk ≤ Risk Tolerance**

---

## 4. Ongoing Risk Management

Risk management is a **continuous cycle**, not a one-time effort.

### Continuous Activities
- **Monitor and Assess Controls** – Regularly test security controls for proper functioning.
- **Measure Effectiveness** – Use metrics to evaluate performance:
  - Number of compromised accounts
  - Number of detected vulnerabilities
  - Number of security incidents or data breaches
- **Management Reporting** – Translate technical findings into business-level insights.
- **Continuous Improvement** – Adjust controls, processes, and training based on findings.

Example:  
A firewall control assessment might involve penetration testing or network scans to ensure only approved traffic is allowed.

---

## 5. Risk Management Frameworks

Frameworks provide structured guidance for managing risk.

### **NIST Risk Management Framework (SP 800-37)**
Six steps in the NIST RMF process:
1. **Categorize** information systems and data.
2. **Select** security controls based on categorization.
3. **Implement** chosen controls.
4. **Assess** controls for correctness and effectiveness.
5. **Authorize** system operation (management formally accepts risk).
6. **Monitor** controls continuously and update as needed.

Inputs required:
- **Technical Architecture Info:** system boundaries, business processes, configurations.  
- **Organizational Info:** laws, regulations, strategies, resource availability.

### **ISO 31000 Framework**
A similar international standard with slightly different structure:
- Establish context  
- Risk identification  
- Risk analysis  
- Risk evaluation  
- Risk treatment  
- Monitoring and review  
- Communication and consultation  

Organizations may adopt **NIST**, **ISO 31000**, or create a **custom hybrid** model.

---

## Final Thoughts
Effective risk management is an **ongoing, data-driven process** that balances:
- Threat awareness  
- Control effectiveness  
- Business practicality  

Security teams must continuously monitor, measure, and improve to keep organizational risks within acceptable limits.

# Risk Visibility, Threat Intelligence, and Automation — Key Takeaways

## 1. Risk Visibility and Reporting

### Purpose
- Ensures risks are **documented, tracked, and monitored** over time.
- Provides transparency across the organization on current risk posture.

### Core Tool — **Risk Register**
- A **centralized document** (or database) tracking each identified risk.
- May be maintained **organization-wide** or for a specific **project/domain**.
- Also called a **Risk Log**.

### Typical Risk Register Elements
| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Risk Description** | Summary of the risk scenario |
| **Category** | Classification or grouping of risks |
| **Risk Owner** | Person accountable for managing the risk |
| **Probability & Impact** | Scores from risk assessment |
| **Risk Rating** | Calculated as Probability × Impact |
| **Mitigation Actions** | Steps taken or planned to reduce the risk |

### Information Sources for Populating Risk Registers
- Results from **formal risk assessments**
- **Audit findings** (internal/external)
- **IT team inputs** from daily operations
- **Third-party threat intelligence** feeds

### Threat Intelligence in Risk Reporting
- **Enhances visibility** by sharing emerging threat information.
- Can be obtained via:
  - **Vendor services**
  - **Threat intelligence sharing consortiums**
- Information often shared **anonymously** to prevent exposure.

### Risk Communication to Executives

# CVSS Scores, Scan Reports, and Legal & Privacy Considerations

## 1. Interpreting CVSS Scores

### Overview
- CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) assigns numeric scores to vulnerabilities based on several metrics.
- Scores help prioritize remediation efforts.

### CVSS v3 Vector Example
- **AV:N** — Access Vector: Network (vulnerability can be exploited remotely)  
- **AC:L** — Attack Complexity: Low (easy to exploit)  
- **PR:N** — Privileges Required: None (no account needed)  
- **UI:N** — User Interaction: None (attacker can act alone)  
- **S:U** — Scope: Unchanged (no access to other systems)  

### Impact Ratings
- **Confidentiality (C): High** — sensitive data may be exposed  
- **Integrity (I): None**  
- **Availability (A): None**  

### Calculating the Base Score
- Use the NIST CVSS calculator by entering each metric.
- Example: AV:N, AC:L, PR:N, UI:N, S:U, C:H, I:N, A:N → Base Score: **7.5**
- Severity levels:
  - 0 → None
  - 0.1–3.9 → Low
  - 4.0–6.9 → Medium
  - 7.0–8.9 → High
  - 9.0–10 → Critical
