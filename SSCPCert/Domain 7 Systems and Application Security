# SSCP Domain 7 – Systems and Application Security
## Key Topic Definitions & Explanations (Exam-Focused)

---

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)
**Definition:**  
A formal contract between a service provider and customer that defines expected service performance, availability, responsibilities, and penalties.

**Includes:**
- Uptime guarantees
- Response and recovery times
- Security responsibilities
- Penalties for non-compliance

**Example:**  
Cloud provider guarantees 99.9% uptime and 4-hour incident response.

---

## Data Portability
**Definition:**  
The ability to securely transfer data between service providers without disruption or data loss.

**Purpose:**
- Prevent vendor lock-in
- Support migration and continuity

**Example:**

---

## Secure Data Destruction
**Definition:**  
The process of permanently and irreversibly destroying data so it cannot be recovered.

**Methods:**
- Cryptographic erasure
- Secure wiping
- Physical destruction

**Example:**  
Encrypting cloud storage and destroying the encryption keys.

---

## Auditing Rights
**Definition:**  
The contractual right to review and verify a service provider’s security controls and compliance.

**Includes:**
- Compliance audits
- Security assessments
- Third-party audits

**Example:**  
Customer audits cloud provider for ISO 27001 compliance.

---

## Malware Countermeasures
**Definition:**  
Security controls used to detect, prevent, and remove malware.

**Examples:**
- Anti-malware software
- Code signing
- Patch management

---

## Insider Threat
**Definition:**  
Security risk posed by authorized users misusing access.

---

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
**Definition:**  
Attack that overwhelms a system with traffic to make it unavailable.

---

## Botnet
**Definition:**  
A network of compromised devices controlled by an attacker.

---

## Zero-Day Exploit
**Definition:**  
Attack exploiting an unknown or unpatched vulnerability.

---

## Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
**Definition:**  
Long-term targeted attack focused on data exfiltration.

---

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
**Definition:**  
Security technology that prevents unauthorized data leakage.

---

## Social Engineering
**Definition:**  
Psychological manipulation to trick users into revealing information.

---

## Behavior Analytics
**Definition:**  
Use of AI, ML, and analytics to detect abnormal behavior.

---

## Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)
**Definition:**  
Software that actively blocks malicious activity on a host.

---

## Host-Based Firewall
**Definition:**  
Firewall that filters traffic on a single system.

---

## Application Whitelisting
**Definition:**  
Security control allowing only approved applications to run.

---

## Endpoint Encryption
**Definition:**  
Encryption protecting data stored on endpoints.

---

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
**Definition:**  
Hardware chip that stores cryptographic keys securely.

---

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
**Definition:**  
Endpoint solution that detects, investigates, and responds to threats.

---

## Mobile Device Management (MDM)
**Definition:**  
Technology used to manage and secure mobile devices.

---

## Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
**Definition:**  
Policy allowing personal devices for work purposes.

---

## Containerization (Mobile)
**Definition:**  
Separates corporate and personal data on a device.

---

## Mobile Application Management (MAM)
**Definition:**  
Controls security of mobile applications instead of devices.

---

## Cloud Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud:** Shared infrastructure
- **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Public + Private
- **Community Cloud:** Shared by similar organizations

---

## Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS:** Customer manages OS & apps
- **PaaS:** Provider manages OS
- **SaaS:** Provider manages everything

---

## Shared Responsibility Model
**Definition:**  
Security responsibilities are shared between provider and customer.

---

## Hypervisor
**Definition:**
