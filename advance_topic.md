**Beacon Frames** in Wi-Fi are management frames that periodically advertise the network's existence and can include information directing users to a captive portal.


for patterns of multiple entries in quick succession is the most effective technique to detect **tailgating**, as it identifies when multiple individuals enter after a single valid badge swipe, a typical indicator of tailgating.


## üìë Agreements and Contracts in Cybersecurity & Business

---

### A. Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- A **formal contract** between a service provider and a customer.  
- Defines:
  - Expected **service quality** (e.g., uptime, response times).  
  - **Performance metrics** and reporting.  
  - **Penalties** for not meeting commitments.  
- Example: A cloud provider guaranteeing **99.9% uptime**.

---

### B. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
- A **formal and legally binding agreement** between two or more parties.  
- Specifies **roles, responsibilities, and obligations**.  
- Stronger than an MOU, but less detailed than a full contract.  

---

### C. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
- A **non-binding agreement** that outlines **intentions** and **collaboration plans**.  
- Used when parties want to express commitment but not yet enter a formal contract.  
- Example: Two companies agreeing to explore a **joint research project**.  

---

### D. Partnership Contract
- A **legally enforceable agreement** that establishes a business partnership.  
- Covers:
  - Profit/loss sharing.  
  - Partner responsibilities.  
  - Legal rights and dispute resolution.  
- Much broader than SLA, MOA, or MOU.  

---

‚úÖ **Key Differences**:  
- **SLA** ‚Üí Service performance commitment.  
- **MOA** ‚Üí Formal, binding, roles defined.  
- **MOU** ‚Üí Informal, non-binding, intent only.  
- **Partnership Contract** ‚Üí Full legal partnership agreement.  

## üåê Types of VPNs

---

### A. Site-to-Site VPN
- Connects **two entire networks** (e.g., branch office ‚Üî headquarters).  
- Used by organizations with **multiple office locations**.  
- Transparent to end users; traffic between sites is encrypted.  
- Often configured on **routers or firewalls**.  

---

### B. Remote Access VPN
- Allows **individual users** to securely connect to a private network.  
- Example: Employees connecting to their company‚Äôs network from home.  
- Requires **VPN client software** or built-in OS support.  

---

### C. SSL/TLS VPN
- A type of **Remote Access VPN** that uses **SSL/TLS encryption**.  
- Users connect via a **web browser** (no special client needed).  
- Popular for secure access to **web applications, email, portals**.  
- Easier to deploy compared to traditional VPNs.  

---

### D. Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) VPN
- A VPN protocol that works at **Layer 2** (Data Link layer).  
- Typically combined with **IPSec** for encryption (L2TP/IPSec).  
- Provides strong security but can be **slower** due to double encapsulation.  
- Supported natively by most operating systems.  

---

‚úÖ **Quick Comparison**
| VPN Type              | Best For                          | Notes |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| **Site-to-Site**      | Office-to-office secure links      | Configured on network devices |
| **Remote Access**     | Individual employee connections    | Requires client or OS support |
| **SSL/TLS VPN**       | Web-based secure access            | Works via browser, user-friendly |
| **L2TP/IPSec VPN**    | Secure tunneling with encryption   | Strong security, more overhead |


## ü¶† Virus ‚Äì Characteristics

- A **virus** is a type of malware that:
  - **Attaches itself to executable files or programs**.
  - **Replicates** by spreading to other files and systems.
  - Often requires **user action** (e.g., running an infected file) to activate.  

- **Spread Mechanism**:
  - Via **file sharing**, **email attachments**, or **infected software**.
  - Once executed, the virus may spread across a **local network** or the internet.  

- **Key Point**:  
  Unlike worms (which spread automatically), viruses **depend on host files** and usually need **human interaction** to propagate.
